            <h2 class="about__title">About us</h2>
            <p class="about__text">We're a small family-run business that started in 1998. We're a small family-runThe
                growth in the American Pizza market in 1986 was what initially grabbed our attention. By 1995, Pizza was
                still the number one growth sector in the fast food industry. This decade of sustained growth in the
                U.S.A showed us that we had only realised the tip of the iceberg in the Irish market and that there was
                huge potential for growth. The Good Food Company recognised a service gap in the market for an Irish
                pizza delivery brand. Apache Pizza was launched in Dublin in 1996. We wanted a strong name that would
                reflect the fact that our pizzas are an original American style, as opposed to the original Italian
                style pizzas which have a different dough base.</p>
            <p class="about__text"">
                Apache Pizza was so named in the spirit of admiration and respect for the indigenous peoples of North and South America. The etymology of the word Apache is widely believed to have come from the Yuma word for 'fighting men' and the Zuni word meaning 'enemy'. Apache, by definition, is a collective term for several culturally related groups of Native tribes who stood up against oppression under the incredible Geronimo.
            </p>
            <p class=" about__text">We are working hard to develop, evolve and improve Apache Pizza in a culturally
                sensitive and considerate way.</p>
            <img src="../img/aboutus.gif">
            <p class="about__text">Since 1996, Apache Pizza have opened over 180 outlets around the country. We are
                committed to developing and expanding Apache Pizza in order to become the biggest and the best pizza
                retail and delivery operator in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The market for delivered/take-away fast
                food is progressing from the traditional 'deep fried' high fat content foods toward fast food which
                constitutes a more balanced nutritional offering to an increasingly discerning consumer. Apache Pizza
                are now leading the way working with Health Pro and providing nutritional values and portion advice not
                only available on our website but also printed on all our menus and available instore.</p>
            <h3 class="about__subtitle">Focused on our Franchisees</h3>
            <p class="about__text">We feel the primary reason for our rapid expansion is due to the fact that, unlike
                our competitors, we remain very focused on our franchisees. Under the leadership of our Managing
                Director, Martin Lyons, Apache has refined and streamlined a user-friendly system that means people from
                all walks of life can come on board and learn the business with ease. This starts with the basics of
                making a pizza, right through to running several stores.</p>
            <h3 class="about__subtitle">Expansion in Northern Ireland</h3>
            <p class="about__text">In 2016, we opened our first store in Portadown. We have since opened a further
                thirty stores across Northern Ireland and aim to continue this growth in the coming years.</p>
